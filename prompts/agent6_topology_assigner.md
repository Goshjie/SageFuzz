# Agent6: Topology & Sender Assigner (Design Placeholder)

This agent is described in point_1.md.

In future stages, it will:
- bind packet_sequence + entities to a concrete topology
- assign tx_host for each packet
- optionally infer ingress_port/egress_port and path annotations

Not implemented in current code stage.
